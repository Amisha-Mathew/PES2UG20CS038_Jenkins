# PES2UG20CS038_Jenkins

Task-1
Aim: Set up Jenkins using Docker.

Task-2
Aim: Set up a job in Jenkins to connect to your repository and build C++ hello.cpp.

Task-3
Aim: Set up a second job that automatically runs after the project builds. This is different
from the other job because this will not have a git repository - it doesn't even build
anything.

Task-4
Aim: Add a webhook trigger to your repository in order to automate builds in Jenkins

Task-5
Aim: To create a basic Jenkins pipeline
